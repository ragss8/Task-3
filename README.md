# Task-3
This a demo-restaurant website which has a home,menu,branches,log-in and new-user sign-up pages "but can only perform operations such as creating a new-user and signing-in and taking up session tokens for the user-session and has a timestamp for per user session and session-expires after that the time is over ",only these are working fine in it.
[Note: Should include Media-queries for all html files in the css folder for using the website on various devices]

Index2.py:
A file that has the fastAPI endpoints such as create-user, log-in and sign-out that performs operations on server-side and storing it to the mongo-db using the pymongoClient libraries.

2.Adding the address Information and contact details for placing the order.
3.Rendering the templates in a more organized manner for smoother experience.
